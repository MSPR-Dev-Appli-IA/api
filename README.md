# About us

The school project "A'rosa-je" helps individuals to take care of their plants. Founded in 1984, it started with a small team of botanists in one city and now has more than 1500 botanists throughout France who serve plant owners in two ways:

- By going to look after their plants when the owners are away
- By providing maintenance advice so that owners can take better care of their plants.

As a result of the pandemic, she is experiencing a sharp increase in demand that she does not have the capacity to meet. In order to do so, they needed to develop a community and automatic option.

The company therefore called on a design and marketing team that proposed to make an application allowing users to keep their plants with a photo sharing and advice.

In the application only botanists will be able to give advice. The company also wants to set up an A.I. to be able to recognize the plants and give some adapted advices beforehand.
